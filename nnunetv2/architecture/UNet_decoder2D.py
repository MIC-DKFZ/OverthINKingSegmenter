        This class needs the skips of the encoder as input in its forward.

        the encoder goes all the way to the bottleneck, so that's where the decoder picks up. stages in the decoder
        are sorted by order of computation, so the first stage has the lowest resolution and takes the bottleneck
        features and the lowest skip as inputs
        the decoder has two (three) parts in each stage:
        1) conv transpose to upsample the feature maps of the stage below it (or the bottleneck in case of the first stage)
        2) n_conv_per_stage conv blocks to let the two inputs get to know each other and merge
        3) (optional if deep_supervision=True) a segmentation output Todo: enable upsample logits?
